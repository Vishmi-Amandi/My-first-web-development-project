## Project Title: 🦁🐘 Zoo Website 🐒🐅

<p>

- I wanted to make something simple and also I love animals. So I decided 
to create a zoo website including different types of animals in different habitats around 
the world. It includes images and information about each animal using HTML and CSS. 
So, this website is for those who are interested in animals’ life. And also for those who 
can’t visit a zoo at the moment.
